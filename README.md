# Batch Rename (Fork)

A fork of the original Batch Rename extension with improved error handling, security, and user experience.

Rename multiple files at once inside the editor window. That way you can use find/replace and multi-cursor.

## How To Use:

- Select files in the explorer sidebar
- Right click one of the files and click "Batch Rename"
- Edit the file names in the editor
- Hit Save to confirm
